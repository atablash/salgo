Salgo
=====
Salgo is a C++17 algorithm template library.

* Very easy to use - modern C++17 interface
	* Concept of Accessors
	* Iterators don't invalidate where you don't want (iterate-and-erase foreach loops, etc.)
* Highly customizable
	* Template type builders allow easy customization of data structures and algorithms
* Performance is critical
	* Lots of optimizations available via templated type builders
	* Included benchmarks comparing Salgo to libstdc++ and libc++, using GCC and Clang





Exception safety
================
No such thing. Google doesn't care, neither do I.
